    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with eggs, hard cheese, cured pork, and black pepper. The dish arrived at its modern form, with its current name, in the middle of the 20th century.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>spaghetti 12 OZ</li>
        <li>guanciale 4 OZ</li>
        <li>very fresh egg yolks 4</li>
        <li>aged Pecorino Romano cheese, grated  2 TBSP</li>
        <li>Grana Padano cheese, grated</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make classic carbonara, first cut the guanciale into 1/4-inch layers, then into long, 2-inch strips.</li>
        <li>Combine the egg yolks with the grated cheeses and a pinch of black pepper. If desired, add 2 tbsp milk for a creamier sauce.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a frying pan and brown the strips of guanciale for 2 minutes until crisp, then turn off the heat and leave to cool.</li>
        <li>Pour the reserved hot water into the part of the frying pan containing the cooled guanciale: this will prevent the pasta from drying out.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pasta to the same pan and mix together,|then add the yolk and cheese mixture, stirring rapidly. In the warm pan with the hot pasta, the eggs will cook gently and become creamy. It is important to do this part quickly to prevent the yolks from congealing and taking on the texture of scrambled eggs.</li>
        <li>Season with freshly-milled black pepper and serve immediately on heated plates.</li>
    </ol>
